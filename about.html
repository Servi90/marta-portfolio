            I was born and raised in Valladolid, a city in northwestern Spain.
            At sixteen I moved to the US, where I graduated from High School. I
            then went on to study Political Science at a distance learning
            university while working in the UK and in 2016 I was accepted into
            the Diplomatic School in Spain where I got my masters in
            International Relations, after which I started working for the
            Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Currently, I am based in the
            UK, working as a visa consultant, and studying a masters in Applied
            Statistics at a distance learning university.<br /><br />
            In 2020 I discovered my passion for coding and so my coding journey
            began. I am currently undertaking classes in HTML, CSS and
            JavaScript. Once I have gained enough Front-end experience I plan to
            further my programming knowledge. <br /><br />
            I have been drawing ever since I can remember and have won many
            drawing contests throughout my school years; The most important
            being in 2001, at eleven years old, when I won a nationwide
            Christmas postcard drawing contest in Spain. Drawing is a real
            passion for me and I would love to become a professional illustrator
            one day.
            <br /><br />
            Photography is another field that inspires me. It was not until 2017
            that I got my first ever reflex camera and was able to snap high
            quality photographs. Still, anywhere I go I like to capture the
            moments and sights I find worth capturing. I more recently had the
            opportunity to photograph a wedding and received quite positive
            feedback.
